# Openbook Credentials

When you have to manage plenty of credentials on a machine where you do not have permission to install any apps or extensions, this app serves as an alternative to `Notepad`, `Excel` or `OneNote`.

# Getting Started

- save [index.html](index.html) and [credentials.js](credentials.js) into the same folder
- put your credentials into [credentials.js](credentials.js)
- open [index.html](index.html)
